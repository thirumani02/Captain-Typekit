## Frequently Asked Question

>	**Where do I find my Typekit Kit ID?**

After creating a kit in Typekit, it'll present you with a couple lines of code to embed. Below that, you'll find your Kit's ID (bottom right corner). It should be 7 or so characters. You'll also be able to find the ID within the embed code on the first line. If you've already created the Kit, you'll be able to find the ID in the Kit Editor.

>	**How do I use the Typekit fonts in my Kit on my site?**

After adding your Kit's ID, there are a few different ways to use your fonts on your site. The first is just by adding selectors in your Kit Editor. The second is adding it within your own CSS, with the Font Family CSS Value found in the Captain Typekit settings page. Usage is explained in detail in [Using Typekit fonts in your own CSS](http://blog.typekit.com/2011/06/29/using-typekit-fonts-in-your-own-css/).

>	**I can't see the table with my Kit's fonts in the Captain Typekit settings page?**

It will only display after you've entered in your Kit's ID and saved, as it needs the ID in order to display the Kit's fonts.
